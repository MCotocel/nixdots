⚠️ I'll admit it, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I could be doing everything perfectly (doubtful), or I could be doing everything wrong, and it only works out of chance and luck. Or, most probably, I'm doing a mix of correct and incorrect things. With that out of the way:

Welcome to my virtual home. I wouldn't advise you to blindly copy large parts from these dotfiles, because if you read the short description above, you'd know it's not a good idea. If you /haven't/ read the description above, go and read it. This whole configuration is managed with NixOS's flake feature (which is currently unstable).

** Information

*** Programs

| OS           | NixOS     |
| WM           | AwesomeWM |
| Editor       | Emacs     |
| Terminal     | Alacritty |
| Shell        | zsh       |
| Launcher     | Rofi      |
| Music player | ncmpcpp   |

*** Setup

- Get the latest minimal NixOS ISO. I get it from [[https://channels.nixos.org][here]]. You may want a slightly more stable ISO.
- Boot into the installer, setup, and mount the disks
  - Depending on which host you want to setup, you'll have to follow different instructions, each in =./hosts/<host>/readme.org=
- Get a nix shell with `git` and `nix flake` set up: =nix-shell -p git nixFlakes=
- Clone these dotfiles to =/etc/nixos=: =git clone https://github.com/mcotocel/nixdots /mnt/etc/nixos=
  - At this point, it would be smart to edit the =hardware-configuration.nix= file to suit your hardware, and additionally add or remove things you need or don't need
- Install NixOS using the flake: =nixos-install --root /mnt --flake /mnt/etc/nixos#host=. If that doesn't work, try it with =--impure=.
  - Host is the host you want to install. A list of hosts is in =./hosts=
- Reboot and change the user password. Unless you want to use root the whole time, which is stupid
- Log in as the normal user and run =nas nix pull= to pull the config to your home folder

*** Why NixOS?

- Declarative package and configuration management
- Lots of packages
- Rollbacks of configurations (When you mess something up (Like the kernel (I've definitely never done this before (Maybe that's a small lie (No, it's a huge lie (Oh, this sentence is starting to look like my messy Emacs config!))))))
- Reliable system
- Reproducible environment

** Images

*** Main

Pretty much my AwesomeWM config, with floating windows and layout switcher. Titlebars can be toggled, but they are off by default. The bottom bar can also be toggled.

*** Emacs

An Emacs config. Pictured are Neotree, Vertico, and Emacs.
